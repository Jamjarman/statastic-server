# statastic-server
Statastic is a generalizable statistics engine which allows users to create, share, and interpret statistics projects.

The project is currently under development. If you're interested in contributing please contact me through github.

The current plan is to write this server component in django. The Stastic-Server will be an open source server, which allows users to host their own instance of statastic. It will offer a JSON api, which anyone can then build a front end for. Future repositiories will contain different front ends for this server, such as a web based front end, mobile applications, or cli client.
